You are doing Continuous Delivery if:
 - software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
 - prioritize keeping software deployable over working on new features
 - fast automated feedback on any change made
 - push button deployment of any software version any time

Continuous delivery != Continuous deployment
C Deployment automatically deploys code after a change while delivery has it ready to be deployed at the push of a button

-Version control
-Tests
-Config management
-Monitoring
