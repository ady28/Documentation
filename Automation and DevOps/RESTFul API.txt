Use HTTP verbs to signal the action your URL will do: GET, DELETE, POST(create), PUT(update)
Use nouns in links and rural nouns are preffered: link/users/324
Make a list with the routes and make functions for actions in the routes

Some HTTP status codes that can be used:
200 - Generic everything is OK
201 - Created something OK
202 - Accepted but is being processed async (for a video means encoding, for an image means resizing,etc)
400 - Bad Request (should really be for invalid syntax, but some folks use for validation)
401 - Unauthorized (no current user and there should be)
403 - The current user is forbidden from accessing this data
404 - That URL is not a valid route, or the item resource does not exist
410 - Data has been deleted, deactivated, suspended, etc
405 - Method Not Allowed (your framework will probably do this for you)
500 - Something unexpected happened and it is the APIs fault
503 - API is not here right now, please try again later

Each request should get only 1 error no matter of what has happened and errors should be only on 4xx and 5xx codes

Tests are very important. Try and test all your routes with correct and incorrect scenarios
