 Parts:
  - Service strategy
  - Service Transition
  - Service Design

 Service operation:
  - Deliver the services to customers at the agreed levels from service design

Example:

 - incident management, access management - processes

Types of service desk:
 Local service desk:
  - If you have 3 locations there will be a service desk in each one
 Centralised service desk:
  - One location for service desk but they support the whole company
 Virtual service desk:
  - Service desk appears to be only one to the end user but there may be more offices
  - Users may be routed by: language,problem type, time of day etc
 Follow the sun service desk:
  - Virtual service desk where calls are routed by time of day. If a user calls at night he will be forwarded to a service desk office where it is day (easier to employ people only for day jobs)

  - Service catalog: services that are in use or will be in use shortly
  - Retired services: not in use anymore but kept in case data is needed
